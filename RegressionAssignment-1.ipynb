    "Advantages :- \n",
    "-> Polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables more accurately than linear regression. This flexibility allows for better modeling of complex data patterns.\n",

    "-> Unlike linear regression, polynomial regression does not assume a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, making it suitable for modeling non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages :- \n",
    "-> As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex and may overfit the training data, capturing noise rather than the underlying pattern. Careful selection of the polynomial degree and regularization techniques are needed to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "->  Polynomial regression models with higher-degree polynomials can be challenging to interpret."
